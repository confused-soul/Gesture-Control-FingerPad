# Gesture-Control-FingerPad
A Music Instrument Project built with integrating Arduino - Electronic Multi-controller  Hardware and Supercollider - Audio Synthesis Software

The Gesture Control Finger Pad is a wearable glove that provides an interactive audio experience based on hand gestures. The glove detects various hand movements and translates them into different tones and sounds. This project is implemented using Arduino for gesture detection and Supercollider software for generating audio tones.

<H2>Features</H2>

<b>Hand Gesture Recognition:</b> The wearable glove is equipped with sensors to detect hand gestures.
<b>Audio Feedback:</b> Different hand gestures trigger different audio tones and sounds.
<b>Interactive Experience:</b> Users can experiment with various hand movements to create unique auditory outputs.
<b>Arduino Integration:</b> Arduino is utilized for gesture recognition and controlling audio playback.
<b>Supercollider Implementation:</b> Supercollider software is used to synthesize and control the audio output.
